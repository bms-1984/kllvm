# KLLVM

KLLVM stands for Kotlin-LLVM. It is intended as a library to work with LLVM in Kotlin.

Currently, it supports the generation of IR code. The rationale is that there are currently no decent options to use
 LLVM
from the JVM: while there is an autogenerated wrapper of the 
[LLVM C++ API for Java](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets/tree/master/llvm) 
it is unusable. For this reason the best option appears to be generating the textual representation of IR code to later
 compile
it to object file (or interpret it directly) using LLVM utilities.

By using KLLVM is it possible to programmatically build the program and then obtain the IR code.
This IR code can then be interpreted using the _lli_ command from LLVM.

It can also be compiled into an executable by running:

```
llc -filetype=obj example.ll
clang example.o -o example
```

## Status

The library is currently used to compile to IR for two Domain Specific Languages. The code is presented in the book 
[How to create pragmatic, lightweight languages](https://tomassetti.me/create-languages).

## Future

We plan to add new features following the requests of the community. One possible option could be to create a wrapper
around the javacpp-presets for LLVM.
